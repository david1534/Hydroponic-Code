Unit Testing: this folder will contain all the unit tests for each individual subsystem. The 
current subsystems are water level sensors, fans, water pump, and LED's. Once the unit tests are writted
and validated on a subsystem level, integration may begin. Integration will involve the cumulative 
combination of unit tests until a final baselined version of tactical code is ready for 
deployment.
