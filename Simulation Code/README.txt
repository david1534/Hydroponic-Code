The setup() function initializes the system, and the loop() function continuously 
checks the water level and updates the pump status. The checkWaterLevel() and checkPumpStatus() 
functions are helper functions that are used to read the water level sensors and control the 
pump, respectively. The PumpPWM variable controls the speed of the pump, with a
higher value indicating a higher speed. The FanPWM variable would be used to control 
the speed of the fans in a similar manner. The pumpStatus variable indicates whether 
the pump is currently on (true) or off (false). The previousTime and previousPumpTime 
variables store the last time the water level and pump status were checked, respectively. 
The stabilityTime, pumpTimeOff, and pumpTimeOn variables are used to control the timing 
of the system. The stabilityTime is the amount of time to wait before changing the 
pump speed, and the pumpTimeOff and pumpTimeOn are the amounts of time to keep the pump off 
and on, respectively. The WaterLevelA, WaterLevelB, WaterLevelC, and WaterLevelD variables
are the pins connected to the water level sensors, and the FanA, FanB, and WaterPump 
variables are the pins connected to the fans and the water pump, respectively. The 
waterLevelA, waterLevelB, waterLevelC, and waterLevelD variables in the loop() function
are used to store the current state of the water level sensors, and the currentTime, 
elapsedTime, currentPumpTime, and elapsedPumpTime variables are used to calculate the current 
time and the amount of time that has passed since the last water level and pump status checks.
The checkWaterLevel() function reads the state of the water level sensors and stores the
results in the waterLevelA, waterLevelB, waterLevelC, and waterLevelD variables. 
The checkPumpStatus() function calculates the current time and the elapsed time since the 
last water level and pump status checks, and then updates the pump status and speed based 
on the current water level and the elapsed time. If the pump is currently on and the elapsed 
time since the last pump status check is less than the specified on time, the function checks 
the water level and adjusts the pump speed accordingly. If the water level is high, the pump 
speed is set to maximum, and if the water level is low, the pump speed is set to minimum. If 
the elapsed time since the last pump status check is greater than the specified on time, the 
pump is turned off. If the pump is currently off and the elapsed time since the last pump status 
check is greater than the specified off time, the pump is turned on. The analogWrite() function 
is used to apply the new pump speed, and the digitalWrite() function is used to turn the pump on 
and off. The pumpStatus variable is updated to reflect the current status of the pump. The 
previousTime and previousPumpTime variables are updated to store the current time. The loop() 
function continuously calls the checkWaterLevel() and checkPumpStatus() functions to monitor the 
water level and control the pump.
